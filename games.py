#Place informations for roms you want to add here.
#You'll first need to enter the rom file name and after that the Game Title
#(look the correct one up in galaxy) and the Game ID.
#Game ID is not that important but should be unique and at best accurate for it not to be marked
#as spam by galaxy. I looked them up at gamefaqs.gamespot.com. Also I removed
# the "-" symbols in it because it messed up some of the games for me.
